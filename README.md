♟️ Chess Game – Python Project 📖 Overview  The Chess Game is a Python-based interactive application where two players can play chess on a graphical board. It uses object-oriented programming to define chess pieces, rules, and valid moves, while providing a GUI interface built with Tkinter or Pygame.  This project is an excellent practice for learning game logic, OOP concepts, GUI programming, and algorithm design in Python.

🚀 Features

🎮 Two-player chess gameplay with a GUI board

✅ Enforces legal chess moves (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king)

👑 Detects check and checkmate conditions

🖥️ Graphical interface built with Tkinter/Pygame

🎓 Beginner-friendly example of combining OOP + game development

🛠 Tech Stack

Language → Python

Libraries → Tkinter / Pygame

Concepts → Object-Oriented Programming, Event Handling, Game Loops

🔹 Sample Python Code (Simplified – Tkinter)
import tkinter as tk

# Board size
BOARD_SIZE = 8
TILE_SIZE = 60

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Chess Game")

canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=BOARD_SIZE*TILE_SIZE, height=BOARD_SIZE*TILE_SIZE)
canvas.pack()

# Draw chessboard tiles
for row in range(BOARD_SIZE):
    for col in range(BOARD_SIZE):
        color = "white" if (row+col) % 2 == 0 else "gray"
        canvas.create_rectangle(col*TILE_SIZE, row*TILE_SIZE,
                                (col+1)*TILE_SIZE, (row+1)*TILE_SIZE, fill=color)

# Place sample pieces (simplified as text instead of images)
pieces = {"R": (0,0), "N": (0,1), "B": (0,2), "Q": (0,3), "K": (0,4)}
for p, (row, col) in pieces.items():
    canvas.create_text(col*TILE_SIZE+30, row*TILE_SIZE+30, text=p, font=("Arial", 24))

root.mainloop()
